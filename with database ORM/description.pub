Project Description:

This Node.js project leverages Sequelize, a powerful Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library, to interact with a MySQL database. Sequelize simplifies database operations by providing a convenient way to define models and relationships between them, allowing developers to focus on application logic rather than complex SQL queries.

Key Features:

Sequelize ORM:

The project utilizes Sequelize as the ORM of choice, enabling developers to define models and interact with the MySQL database using JavaScript objects rather than raw SQL queries.
MySQL Database:

The backend of the application is powered by a MySQL database, known for its reliability and scalability. Sequelize seamlessly integrates with MySQL, facilitating efficient data storage and retrieval.
Data Relationships:

Sequelize supports the establishment of relationships between different data models. This project takes advantage of Sequelize associations to create and navigate relationships such as one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many between entities in the database.
Scalability:

The use of Sequelize and MySQL ensures the project's scalability, allowing it to handle growing amounts of data and complex relationships with ease.
CRUD Operations:

The application showcases Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations through Sequelize, providing a comprehensive set of functionalities to manage data in the MySQL database.
Technology Stack:

Node.js: JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
Sequelize: Object-Relational Mapping library for interacting with databases.
MySQL: Reliable and scalable relational database management system.
Express.js: Web application framework for Node.js, enhancing the development of RESTful APIs.
Usage:

Developers can clone the repository, configure the database connection in the Sequelize configuration file, and use the defined models to perform database operations.
Note: Ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed, and the MySQL server is running for seamless integration with the project.
